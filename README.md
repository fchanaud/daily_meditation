## How It Works

1. User selects their current mood from 10 options
2. User chooses their preferred language
3. App searches Pixabay and Archive.org for suitable meditation audio
4. Audio is streamed directly in the browser with controls
5. Audio files are temporarily cached for better performance

## Technical Details

The application is built using:

- FastAPI for the backend API
- Jinja2 templates for server-side rendering
- Bootstrap for responsive UI design
- HTML5 audio player for meditation playback
- BeautifulSoup for web scraping

## Python Version Requirements

**Important: This application requires Python 3.11.x**

The application is not compatible with Python 3.12 or newer due to dependency constraints with FastAPI, Pydantic, and other libraries. We recommend using Python 3.11.7 for optimal compatibility.

To set up a Python 3.11 environment:

```bash
# If you have pyenv installed
pyenv install 3.11.7
pyenv local 3.11.7

# Create virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

If you're using Python 3.12+ and encounter the following error:
```
TypeError: ForwardRef._evaluate() missing 1 required keyword-only argument: 'recursive_guard'
```

This is due to incompatibility between the installed FastAPI/Pydantic versions and Python 3.12+. Please switch to Python 3.11.x.

## Running the App

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/daily-meditation.git
cd daily-meditation

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Start the application
./start.sh

The app will be available at http://localhost:8000
